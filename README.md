# Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing skills, projects, and contact information.

## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment

This site is configured to be deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Merge this PR** to the `main` branch
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings:
   - Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under "Build and deployment":
     - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**
   - The workflow will automatically deploy the site

3. **Access your site** at: `https://tejassinghrajput.github.io/temp/`

### How it Works

- The `.github/workflows/static.yml` workflow automatically deploys the site when changes are pushed to the `main` branch
- The workflow can also be manually triggered from the Actions tab
- The entire repository content is deployed, making the `index.html` the homepage
